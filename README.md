## Environment Variables

You will need to declare a `PLOT_DIR` in your environment where you want plots written out to.
This will be important as an environment variable in some of the programs that make plots.

You will also need to declare a `DATA_DIR` where all your ARA ROOT data files and processed products are stored.

And, a `PED_DIR`, where the ARA pedestals are stored.
