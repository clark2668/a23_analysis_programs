These are intended to be examples for how to get up and running with ARA data or demonstrate useful things we can do with ARA data.

You need to have a functioning version of araROOT intalled somewhere, and ROOT. Both need to be accesible from your shell environment as ARA_UTIL_INSTALL_DIR and ROOTSYS.

Compile like `example_ara_analysis`

Run instructions are in the cxx file itself
